# Simple Angular 4 Reuse Component
This is just a example, to show how I code a simple "One Page App" using `Angular 4`.
You probably found this code through my `CV` or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armandoschiavondias/).

## Mission:
This time, the idea is build a component, reuse it how many times the user need and make it able to exchange data between they.
Let's use [Material Angular](https://material.angular.io/) to make it looks nice.
Click on icons to make it work!
This code was created as example purpose.

Some points that I keep in mind all the time:
- [Object Calisthenics](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf) ( Always when possible... )
- I am using `TESlint` ( ESLint for TypeScript Files ): This helps a lot with the code's pattern.
- I am using `TypeScript` because I choose `Angular.io` (4.x) and not `Angularjs.org` (1.x).
